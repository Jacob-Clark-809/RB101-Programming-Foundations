! is the NOT operator. It converts true to false and vice versa.
? is the ternary operator. It takes three operands: the first is a
conditional that determines which of the following two operands will be
executed.

1. != is the not equal to operator and should be used when we want to
compare two values to see if they're equal, getting false if they are
and true if they're not.

2. !user_name will give true if user_name is false or nil; it will give
false in all other cases.

3. In the case of words.uniq! uniq! is just a method call and the ! is
not being used as the NOT operator. Normally when a method ends with ! it
signifies that the method mutates the caller.

4 + 5. The ternary operator is used as such:
condition ? eval if true : eval if false
The statement "condition" before the ? is evaluated as a boolean and
determines which of the statements following the ? is run.

6. Putting !! before something will evaluate it as a boolean, all truthy
values will evaluate as true, otherwise false.
